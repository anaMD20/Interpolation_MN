# Interpolation_MN

Interpolation is a method by which approximate intermediate values ​​of a function are obtained
for which only part of the values ​​are known.
Within the theme, we implemented two interpolation methods applied to images:

• Proximal Interpolation;
• Bicubic interpolation.

Specifically, they will be used to resize and rotate images.
We want to apply a geometric transformation, denoted by T, on an image. Transformation
geometric figures are represented in matrix form because they facilitate the composition process.
Interpolation provides a way to calculate the pixel values ​​in the final image based on those in the initial image.
